# Metagenomics-review

## Advantages of metagenomcs comparing to 16S
- full genomes
- other kindoms like viruses, fungi, other eucaryotes 

## Terms 

- Taxonomy - a biological naming system, where each item is a taxomonc unit.  a tr representing a naming system we use to clasify microbal organisms. 

- We will not be taking about 16S, which is not metgemonics 

- Chimera - sequencing artifacts 

[picture here]


- Marker gene analysis methods - to solve taxonomic profile problem. 
- Taxonomic profile - taxa present in the data. Taxa is the node in the tree. 
- Taxonomic profiling - infer Taxonomic profile from reads
- Assembly - is NP hard (cite) due to horizontal gene transfer. Make a minimum example which is not solvabable. 
- Read binning, eaither on assembled contihgs or on the read. Each  bin ideally should correponds to strans/genome. Like clustering 

- Better than mapping, it can detect binds corresponding to novel organims.  

## Biology want to know
- binning define a reference and do it across all sample. After the bins are defined you go back on the per smaple level and track the relative abundances of the bins across the samples. 

- partical asssemble - assemble partical path in the assemble (de Bruin graph)


### Binning - contis or reads
Binning reads is hard due to homology problem. 

### Taxonomic binning 
- place the conting on the lowest possible node in the taxonomic tree.
