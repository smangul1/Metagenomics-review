# Metagenomics-review

## Terms 

- Taxonomy - a biological naming system, where each item is a taxomonc unit.  a tr representing a naming system we use to clasify microbal organisms. 

- We will not be taking about 16S, which is not metgemonics 

- Chimera - sequencing artifacts 

[picture here]


- Marker gene analysis methods - to solve taxonomic profile problem. 
- Taxonomic profile - taxa present in the data. Taxa is the node in the tree. 
- Taxonomic profiling - infer Taxonomic profile from reads
- Assembly - is NP hard (cite) due to horizontal gene transfer. Make a minimum example which is not solvabable. 
- Read binning, eaither on assembled contihgs or on the read. Each  bin ideally should correponds to strans/genome. Like clustering 

- Better than mapping, it can detect binds corresponding to novel organims.
